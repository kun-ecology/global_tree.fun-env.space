## **Contents**

1. **Code**
   - **`merged_fun.R`**: Contains the code for TPD (Trait Probability Density) calculations. This code is derived from the study published at [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf2675).

2. **Data**
   - **`df202502.RDS`**: A data frame used for analyses
   - **`tree_phy202502.RDS`**: A phylogenetic tree used for data analyses

3. **Figures**
   - **`trait&env.ai`** and **`net_changeTPD.sum.ai`**: Refined Fig.1 and Fig.2

4. **Analyses and Visualization**
   - **`tree_naturalization_extinction.qmd`**: The Quarto file containing the main analyses and visualization code
